name: Plate with hole
description: |
  In this script we solve the linear plane strain elasticity problem for an
  infinite plate with a circular hole under tension. We do this by placing the
  circle in the origin of a unit square, imposing symmetry conditions on the
  left and bottom, and Dirichlet conditions constraining the displacements to
  the analytical solution to the right and top. The traction-free circle is
  removed by means of the Finite Cell Method (FCM).
