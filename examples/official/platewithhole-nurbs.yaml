name: Plate with hole using nurbs
description: |
  In this script we solve the same infinite plane strain problem as in
  [example:official-platewithhole], but instead of using FCM to create the hole
  we use a NURBS-based mapping. A detailed description of the testcase can be
  found in Hughes et al., `Isogeometric analysis: CAD, finite elements, NURBS,
  exact geometry and mesh refinement`, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics
  and Engineering, Elsevier, 2005, 194, 4135-4195.
